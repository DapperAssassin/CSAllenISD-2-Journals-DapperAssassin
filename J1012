1.1
Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.
The process of addition is moving to the right along the numberline of the base.

2.1
What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?
When you exceed the base of 8 when adding, then there are steps to adjust the number through carrying the number to the next column similar to base ten addition.
3.1
What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?
You have to consider the letters and their values, and again use the process of carrying the number in order to get the correct addition.
4.1
What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?
Since the number is either 1 or 0 when it exceeds 1 it moves to the next column over.
What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
All of the additions are similar, but they have some special rules when you need to carry and add in the next column. 
What challenges did I encounter?
I'm struggling to understand some of the details with the different bases, hopefully the mission will help.  
How could this experience be improved?
I think having a few more examples of each one would help in understanding the idea better. 
Free Reflection: How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?
In general this class makes it so I have to think more.  I think it is helping with problem solving and allowing me to look at things differently.
