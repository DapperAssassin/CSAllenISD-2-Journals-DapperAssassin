1.1
What is git communicating to you?
At first it is communicating untracked files in red.
1.2
What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?
They are similar, but have different displays and wording.  It still showed we had one new file.
1.3
Why do you think this is?
I think it is because the log shows what we have completed and the commit is what is availble to be put in github.
2.1
What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?
They are both listed as unfiled
2.2
Are they both displayed in the same section?  If not, why not?
No, one was edited and one was new.
3.1
What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?
They are displayed in green with different references. 
3.2
Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.
File 1 is listed as modified, while file 2 is listed as new.
4.1
How many files are listed as having been changed?

 Two files have been changed.
What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?
File 1 recieved a new line, and file 2 recieved a new line in a new file.
5.1
What does git tell you has changed? Why?

   2 | # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
      3 | # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit\
             .
	        4 | #
		   5 | # On branch master
		      6 | # Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
		         7 | #
			    8 | # Changes to be committed:
			       9 | #       modified:   file1.txt
			         10 | #       new file:   file2.txt

It shows that file 1 was changed and that file two is new.
