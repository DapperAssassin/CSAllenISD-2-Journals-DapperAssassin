1.1
Two systems I use would be emails and files for school. I suppose typically I use the Google System or canvas which would both have a client/ server model.

Yes I think it is important for users to have directories of the same name, because sometimes a name makes sense. If you can't call the file mydocuments for example, you would have to make up unique names, and it would be difficult to remember where items are located.
What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?
I've learned how to nagivate my code, and work in the journal.
What challenges did I encounter?
I struggled to get the journal started and working. I ended up attending tutorials to try and get it working for class.
How could this experience be improved?

Free Reflection: How has what I've learned impacted my thinking?
In general this class makes it so I have to think more. I think it is helping with problem solving and allowing me to look at things differently
